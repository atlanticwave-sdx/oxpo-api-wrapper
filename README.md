# oxpo-api-wrapper

Designed to simplify interactions with various OXPO (Open eXchange Point Operator) APIs by providing a unified and simplified programming interface. The wrapper abstracts the complexities of direct API calls and offers a consistent method to interact with different OXPO services, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

## Key Features

## Unified API Calls
Standardize the way applications communicate with different OXPOs, regardless of their underlying API differences.

## Error Handling
Robust error handling mechanisms are built in to manage API response variability and ensure reliable application behavior.

## Authentication Management
Handles all aspects of authentication automatically, from token generation to renewal, ensuring seamless access to OXPO services.

## Response Parsing
Automatically parses responses into user-friendly formats, reducing the need for repetitive parsing logic in the main application code.

## Extensibility
Easily extendible to accommodate new endpoints or changes in existing OXPO API specifications.

## Logging and Monitoring
Integrated logging for debugging and monitoring API interactions, facilitating easier troubleshooting and performance tracking.
